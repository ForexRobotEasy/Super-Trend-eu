# Super Trend eu

This code is an example of an Expert Advisor (EA) developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to perform trend analysis using the R2 and R3 parameters and provide insights on potential entries, exits, and stop levels for traders.

## How it works

The EA calculates the R2 and R3 parameters during initialization. The R2 parameter is calculated using the pivot point formula, where it multiplies the pivot point (average of high, low, and close prices) by the difference between the high and low prices. The R3 parameter is calculated by squaring the current high price.

During each tick, the EA compares the R2 and R3 parameters. If R2 is greater than R3, it indicates an uptrend, and if R2 is less than or equal to R3, it indicates a downtrend. The EA then provides a message indicating the current market trend and suggests implementing a trading strategy accordingly.
